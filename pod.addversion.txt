# 1) Update the .podspec with the new version number

# 2) validate the pod, without downloading
pod lib lint --sources="https://github.com/crspybits/Specs.git,https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git"

# 3) then push updated revision of pod to its repo

# Push updated tag
git tag 2.0.2
git push --tags

# 4) validate the pod, with downloading
pod spec lint --sources="https://github.com/crspybits/Specs.git,https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git"

# 5) Then, to push my podspec to my Specs repo:
# See also: ls ~/.cocoapods/repos/
# These need to be done from the relevant directory, e.g., SMCoreLib

pod repo push crspybits-specs SMCoreLib.podspec --sources="https://github.com/crspybits/Specs.git,https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git"
